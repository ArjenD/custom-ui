## Lovelace custom-ui

This repository contains some custom elements I have created for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)

# Graph card
A more advanced history graph card that allows you to zoom on your data etc.

# Swipe card
A card that wraps cards in a [swiper.js](https://idangero.us/swiper/) container so you can swipe trough them.
